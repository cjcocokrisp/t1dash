    <h3>A Self Hostable Type 1 Diabetes Data Dashboard</h3>
</div>

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a self hostable dashboard to display Type 1 Diabetes related information including data from various sources and provide statistics. It also will aim to automate and interact with devices (CGMs or Pumps) that allow for viewing it's data. Data and charts generated by this application will also be exportable to be shared with others.
